## Introduction

This project explores clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods applied to student data. It aims to analyze student data using techniques such as KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages: `readr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `factoextra`, `ggplot2`.
3. Download the student data CSV file and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Open the R script file in your preferred R environment.
5. Run the script to perform clustering and dimensionality reduction analysis.

## Usage

- `main_script.R`: This script contains the main analysis code, including reading the data, performing PCA, clustering, and visualization.
- `student_data.csv`: This CSV file contains the student data used in the analysis.

## Results

- PCA Analysis: The PCA analysis revealed that the first two principal components explain X% of the variance in the data.
- Clustering Results: KMeans clustering identified three clusters, while hierarchical clustering resulted in similar cluster distributions.
